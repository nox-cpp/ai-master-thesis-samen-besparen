# Thesis code base
This code base has been developed as part of a AI master thesis project at the University of Groningen in collaboration with Grunneger Power.

The repository is split into three folders. The data_processing folder contains R code and bash scripts for data wrangling and setting up experiments. The experiments folder contains experiment scripts and NetLogo behaviorspace templates. The model folder contains the NetLogo model code.

In order to use some of the scripts an environment file must be defined. Generally speaking, scripts are to be run from the top of the repository.
