; This file contains the routines required to set up validation cases that aim
; to demonstrate the validity of the model

; This simulation is set up such that it converges to all agents reaching the
; same decision in the end
to Setup-Validation-One
  Setup-Generic-Basis
end

; This simulation is set up such that two agents maintain a dilemma state in the
; end and one other agent is satisfied
